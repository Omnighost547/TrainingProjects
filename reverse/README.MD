# Reverse String

Quite simply, reverse a given String.

You can use whichever method you choose, the more options you come up with the better

There are some tests in src/test/java to help you get started, I suggest you attempt them in order (comment out the ones you don't want to run)

## Bonus Material

1. Have the reverse method ignore any whitespace characters
2. Instead of reversing the entire String, only reverse whole words
