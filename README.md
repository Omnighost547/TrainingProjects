# Training Projects #
The goal of these projects is to get you writing code. 
These are not for teaching you to write code or to teach you specifics of Java.  
For example, suppose you need to iterate over some data. You could use a for loop, 
a for each loop, an iterator, a while loop, a do loop, recursion, a stream, whatever.   
Once you identify a particular construct to use, you should change it to something else

## Tests ## 
Each module has a set of tests with it, to help you reach a solution, but also to help you understand
the problem domain.

I used the @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING) method in JUnit to allow me to get the tests to run in a 
specific order.  
This is a terrible idea and you should never use it in tests for production code, but for this training it allows me to 
lay out the tests in a TDD type order to help you arrive at a solution.  

You can comment out all tests apart from the first one and then build up your suite of tests.
