# Training Projects #
The goal of these projects is to get you writing code. 
These are not for teaching you to write code or to teach you specifics of Java.  
For example, suppose you need to iterate over some data. You could use a for loop, 
a for each loop, an iterator, a while loop, a do loop, recursion, a stream, whatever.   
Once you identify a particular construct to use, you should change it to something else. Try out solutions that use all the methods given. By doing this, you will become familiar with the nuances of each, and gain an understanding of when you would use one of another.  


## Tests ## 
Each module has a set of tests with it, to help you reach a solution, but also to help you understand
the problem domain.

I used the @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING) method in JUnit to allow me to get the tests to run in a 
specific order.  
This is a terrible idea and you should never use it in tests for production code, but for this training it allows me to 
lay out the tests in a TDD type order to help you arrive at a solution.  

You can comment out all tests apart from the first one and then build up your suite of tests.
   
## Grading ##
I will not be grading any of this work. I can give feedback on what I think about your code, but that isn't the point of the projects.  
Programming, like any other skill, has to be practiced. If you don't practice problem solving, you will get rusty and lose your edge. Practicing on simple things will build you confidence, but also let you see different ways of approaching the same problem. Think about your solution, what would you do differently. If the computer crashed and you lost all your work, what changes would you make.

## Git ##
Feel free to use as many commits as possible when running the tests. Git won't have any problem with you creating a commit every time you change a line of code, so do that. You need to get comfortable with git as well

## TDD ##
I have laid the tests out with TDD in mind, but TDD is not the focus of this particular exercise.
