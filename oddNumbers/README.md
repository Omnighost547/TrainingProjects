# Odd Numbers #
Write some code to return all the odd numbers between 0 and some upper limit.
The trivial answer of course is to use modulo operator, but how many other solutions can you think of.
Sample tests have been added to get you started.

## Bonus Material ##
* Can you do this without using modulo or addition/subtraction/multiplication/division operators.
* Instead of giving odd numbers between 0 and some limit, instead return the first x number of odd numbers  
ie if x is 10, instead of odd numbers between 0 and 10, return the first 10 odd numbers.
