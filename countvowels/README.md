# Count Vowels #

Your task is to write some code to count occurrences of vowels in a String.  
Your method should return a map with each vowel mapped to the count.  
There are tests provided to help you, including some JUnitParams data driven tests.  
You should experiment with as many different approaches as you can think of, using Streams gives a 
nice concise bit of code, but is not the only approach.  
How do you get a map to return 0 instead of null is another question you need to answer.

## Bonus Material ##
* Consider ignoring case of the letters
* Use a regex instead of whatever you have already
* How would you change to count consonants
;* How would you make it so that the user could decide if they wanted to count vowels or consonants or both
